                    Our leader and CO, CupOHemlock hosted an Invitational that garnered more than 36 people throughout the day in playing Walker Assault, Blast 
                    and DLC matches and the first ever coveted <a href="http://www.clanaod.net/forums/showthread.php?t=132140"><b>Battlefront CO Invitational </b> </a>Gold and Silver badges, which were awarded to each team based on who
                    won the event.  I am proud to say that the Youth team beat the Experience team in true AOD fashion!  It was a BLAST and pleasure to see such 
                    a great turnout for the CO's Invitational event! </p>

                <hr/>
                <p>Battlefront is working hard to help bring people to the game and proof of it is in their recent promotion 
                a few weeks ago (May13-15th) by giving 4 hours of free OUTER RIM game play to subscribers.  This shows their dedication to 
                the future of the game and helps to continue to build the community.  They have also recently released new details 
                on Battlefront 2, which will be coming to a star system near you in late 2017.  Check <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-battlefront-2-confirmed-features-content/1100-6439682/"><b>Here</b> </a> for more information.</p>

                <hr/>
                <p>As the dust from the Outer Rim release starts to settle we want to take a quick look ahead at the second piece of 
                Star Wars Battlefront DLC.  We don’t have a specific Star Wars Battlefront Bespin DLC release date just yet but we do 
                have a specific window to look forward to. For Season Pass holders.  EA DICE says that it’s planning to release its 
                second Battlefront expansion in June for Season Pass holders. Initially, the company had said summer. The first day of 
                summer here in the United States is June 21st.  We’re already seeing a number of theories floating around and many 
                gamers are predicting a release on June 28th with a general release on July 12th after the July 4th weekend.  In its 
                announcement, EA DICE confirmed a brand new game mode and four brand new maps for Star Wars Battlefront. The company 
                says that these maps will be for the game’s “most popular modes.”  EA DICE has confirmed plans to release two new heroes
                in the Bespin DLC. As expected, fan favorite Lando Calrissian and also included is the bounty hunter Dengar.  If you 
                want to ensure that you get Bespin next month, you'll want to think about picking up a copy of the Season Pass. Just be 
                sure to look for a deal before you buy it.  Check <a href="http://www.ecumenicalnews.com/article/star-wars-battlefront-bespin-dlc-release-could-happen-on-june-28/44319.htm"><b>Here</b> </a> to learn more.</p>

                <p>The Battlefron Division is growing at a fast pace and there is an increasing number of people that ask about where important
