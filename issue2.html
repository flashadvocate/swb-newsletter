                <div class="row"></div> </a>Most of us have already seen or played the new BESPIN DLC thats coming out and for 
                those that haven't need to get out from under their rock and check it out!  Star Wars Battlefront's Bespin expansion 
                launched on June 21 (for some), and shared all the key details about it.  Everyone else can buy it two weeks later, 
                beginning on July the 5th.</p>
                <p></p>Bespin includes five maps set in the Cloud City, including arenas called Administrator's Palace and Carbon-Freezing 
                Chambers. Another map is titled Bioniip Laboratories; it is set in a manufacturing laboratory "where cybernetics and 
                other bio-implants" are made. The expansion also adds two new Heroes, Lando Calrissian and Dengar, while it introduces 
                a new vehicle, the Cloud Car, as well.</p>
                <p>Also included are some new weapons in the form of the X8 Night Sniper and the 
                EE4 blaster. New Star Cards include Scout Binoculars that reveal enemy locations to teammates, a Shock Grenade that 
                freezes enemies in place for a period of time, and another called Disruption. This pushes out a "disruption wave that 
                knocks out enemy blasters, turrets, and droids.  If your looking for more urban battles and a new slew of great weapons
                and upgrade, this is a great expansion!  "<a href="https://www.gottabemobile.com/2016/06/27/10-things-to-know-about-the-battlefront-bespin-release/"><b>For

                <hr/>
 

                
                <p><div class="img-thumbnail article-img" style="background-image: url('images/bespin2.jpg');"></div>

                <p><div class="row"></div> Hello to the AOD Battlefront Community! This be your AOD Battlefront Community Manager GoDziLLa. This year 
                I had the opportunity to attend EA’s first ever EA Play event in Downtown Los Angeles, and what a weekend it was! 
                The event went off great; I liked that they made there own type of event apart from E3, which tends to be closed 
                to the public and only open to news/media guys. Best part was that it turned out to be totally free. I was lucky 
                enough to have gotten onto the early bird list which was sent out around late April/early May, with public tickets 
                available for everyone else a few weeks later. Tickets were very limited so you can imagine how fast they went out! 
                The area was packed with gamers from Xbox, Playstation, and PC, as well as big YouTubers like Jackfrags, LevelCap, 
                Star Wars HQ, and BattlefrontUpdates. I even got the chance to meet StoneMountain64! When you first enter the event 
                building, you are literally surrounded by a million different games to tryout. Of course, there were food stands 
                and a gift shop too. </p>
                <p>Now! Battlefield 1; let me say it blew my mind when I had the chance to play it. Definitely 
                feels nice to be back to its world war theme and it feels really well done. From there they had other games to 
                try out like FIFA 2017, and Madden 2017. Titanfall 2 was another game I had in mind when I first showed up. The 
                game felt good, but it kinda had me confused because I've never played the first one. BUT! If you're a Titanfall 
                fan then I know you'll love whats coming with this sequel. Star Wars did not have anything to offer as far as 
                gameplay for future games or anything coming soon for EA Star Wars. I got a chance to play the Bespin DLC early; 
                But the real treat was a little something extra for Battlefront; and that's for me to know and for you to find out! 
                Soon™! (NDA :P )</p> 
                <p>This event was really a big benefit to the clan in it's own way. It's a special and unique place 
                where you can get noticed in the community, and if you're lucky you get to meet some developers when you least expect 
                it! On top of all that a public event is a great chance for other AOD members to meet up at! Deity and I met up early 
                on at EA Play and did our own thing. But we also hung out with some other members from the Battlefield Division like 
                Mas-Yzk and Grady. EA Play is something I would love to do it again if they decide to continue having this event in 
                the future. So if they do, sign up for next years event and maybe I'll see you out there!                -Godz.</p>

                <p>As the dust from the Outer Rim release starts to settle we want to take a quick look ahead at the second piece of 
                Star Wars Battlefront DLC.  We don’t have a specific Star Wars Battlefront Bespin DLC release date just yet but we do 
                have a specific window to look forward to. For Season Pass holders.  EA DICE says that it’s planning to release its 
                second Battlefront expansion in June for Season Pass holders. Initially, the company had said summer. The first day of 
                summer here in the United States is June 21st.  We’re already seeing a number of theories floating around and many 
                gamers are predicting a release on June 28th with a general release on July 12th after the July 4th weekend.  In its 
                announcement, EA DICE confirmed a brand new game mode and four brand new maps for Star Wars Battlefront. The company 
                says that these maps will be for the game’s “most popular modes.”  EA DICE has confirmed plans to release two new heroes
                in the Bespin DLC. As expected, fan favorite Lando Calrissian and also included is the bounty hunter Dengar.  If you 
                want to ensure that you get Bespin next month, you'll want to think about picking up a copy of the Season Pass. Just be 
                sure to look for a deal before you buy it.  Check <a href="http://www.ecumenicalnews.com/article/star-wars-battlefront-bespin-dlc-release-could-happen-on-june-28/44319.htm"><b>Here</b> </a> to learn more.</p>
