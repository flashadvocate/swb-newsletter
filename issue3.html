                <p><div class="row"></div> The third Death Star DLC for Star Wars: Battlefront will arrive in September. But Season Pass owners will get it two weeks ahead of  others. It will center around the Death Star spaceship and also introduce Chewbacca.</p>
                <p>They can choose from two different modes on a various difficulty level at their own choice. Players can go into the battlefront in a Walker Assault or they can take the battle in the air in a Fighter Squadron in Skirmish
This new offline mode will be played against bots. Players can enjoy the game in multiple locations by choosing a coop split screen option. However, this option is only available for PS4 and Xbox One.
According to EA, Skirmish is their response to the fans’ demand for additional offline game mode for the game. It introduces new maps as well as exciting combats inside and outside the Death Star.
“Test your skill by taking off and flying through a trench on the surface of the Death Star,” reads EA’s news from the official
Death Star DLC also introduces one of the most adorable characters, Chewbacca. He is one of the characters that fans have requested for so long. It seems inadequate if fans would just see Han Solo alone in the game. Finally, Chewie will be reunited with his partner in crime.
Also, a new character introduced along with Chewie is the Trandoshan bounty hunter, Bossk. Avid fans can remember the hissing lizard man in barefoot with his famous line in the Clone Wars. The line goes, “You got a problem with Boba, you got a problem with me.”
The Death Star DLC also comes with brand new blasters, vehicles, and Star Cards. Check out additional details about the next expansion for Star Wars: Battlefront via EA’s official page.
The event further revealed about Rogue One: Scarif DLC. It will be the fourth and final expansion for the game coming in December. The expansion will introduce new characters Jyn Erso and Director Krennic as new playable hero and villain, respectively. Scarif planet will appear in the upcoming film, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.
The Star Wars: Battlefront Death Star DLC will be available two weeks ahead of those who have the Season Pass.</p>

                <hr/>
                <p>DICE SWEDEN - The developers of Battlefront gave the AOD:  Battlefront Division a rare and honored opportunity to play some
                friendly battles with and against some of the DICE Development team in a private match on June 24th.  The turnout was great and
                the amount of interest surrounding the event made it a huge success.  DICE has already agreed to entertain a possible future event, 
                so lets hope we made a good first impression with them and that they will bring many more developers to play us next time.</p><p>The 
                match play lasted about 3 hours and there were more than 35 AOD members that got a chance to take shots at Sir Slusk and company.  
                Game play was cordial, but it was apparent that DICE developers know their way around the battlefield and actually have some good 
                game play skills.</p><p>Finally, we need to give a big hand to GoDziLLa for putting in so much work and putting together this lil' 
                shindig so we could have a chance to no only talk with DICE Sweden, but also let them know what kind of players we have at AOD!</p>
