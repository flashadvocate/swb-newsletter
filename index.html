                <p>Battlefront is working hard to help bring people to the game and proof of it is in their recent promotion 
                from May13-15th by giving 4 hours of free OUTER RIM game play to subscribers.  This shows their dedication to 
                the future of the game and helps to continue to build the community.  They have also recently released new details 
                on Battlefront 2, which will be coming to a star system near you in late 2017.  Check <a href=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-battlefront-2-confirmed-features-content/1100-6439682/""><b>Here</b> </a> for more information.</p>

                <p>May the 4th is an important day in the lives of Star Wars fans, and nothing could commemorate it more than an event to fit the occasion.
                Our leader and CO, CupOHemlock hosted an Invitational that garnered more than 36 people throughout the day in playing Walker Assault, Blast 
                and DLC matches and the first ever coveted <a href=http://www.clanaod.net/forums/showthread.php?t=132140"><b>Battlefront CO Invitational </b> </a>Gold and Silver badges, which were awarded to each team based on who
                won the event.  I am proud to say that the Youth team beat the Experience team in true AOD fashion!  It was a BLAST and pleasure to see such 
                a great turnout for the CO's Invitational event! </p><img border="0" src="https://heavyeditorial.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/may-the-fourth-4th-be-with-you-memes-gifs-star-wars-day-18.gif?width="135" height="100" ">
